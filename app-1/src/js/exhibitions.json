            "title": "Jeweled Splendors of the Art Deco Era: The Prince and Princess Sadruddin Aga Khan Collection",
            "text": "These exquisite jeweled objects highlight the creative and spirited era broadly examined in The Jazz Age: American Style in the 1920s and showcase the collecting skills of Prince and Princess Sadruddin Aga Khan. Both connoisseurs of artistic traditions valued for their intricacy of detail –he for Persian miniatures, she for early books and manuscripts - their eye for complex creations is manifest  in these boxes for cigarettes, compacts, and vanity cases, as well as in the jeweled clocks and watches. True “objects of vertu”— luxury objects whose virtuosity of craftsmanship is at least as important as their function —these small compositions incorporate geometric and arabesque motifs in enamel, or exotic scenes from the Far to Middle East in inlaid shell. Designed mostly for women engaged in socially adventurous activities—such as cigarette smoking, going to night clubs, applying makeup in public, or checking the time—they were later collected as works of art more than for use. \nPrince Sadruddin, born in Paris, Harvard educated, multilingual, and multicultural, worked for over 40 years for the United Nations, serving as UN High Commissioner for Refugees for 12 years. A co-founder of the Paris Review and an ardent environmentalist, he was also a great art collector, especially of Islamic Art. This extraordinary and extensive collection, created for his Egyptian-born wife Catherine from 1972 until his death in 2003, has never been exhibited publicly.",

            "title": "The Jazz Age: American Style in the 1920s",
            "text": "A creative explosion in design and art lit up the 1920s. The Jazz Age explores the dynamic changes in American taste and lifestyles during this period through a broad range of furniture, jewelry, fashion, textiles, decorative arts, and architecture, as well as art, film, and music. The influences that fueled this burst of innovation, exoticism, and modernity were manifold and flowed back and forth across the Atlantic. Jazz music, a uniquely American art form that sprang from African American musicians who preserved and improvised on its historic roots, also found a ready audience in Europe. An apt metaphor for the era’s embrace of urbanity and experimentation, jazz captured the pulse and rich mixture of cultures and rhythms that brought a new beat to contemporary life.\nSignificant influences from Europe included avant-garde artistic movements; the Paris 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts décoratifs et industriels modernes; recent immigrant designers, primarily from Austria and Germany; traveling exhibitions featuring the latest designs, many available for sale; and fashion and jewelry acquired overseas. At home, new modes of transportation and the development of industrial design with its impact on consumer products and the interior profoundly shaped American taste. Equally exciting and important as these influences were the rapid growth of American cities and architecture—most notably the soaring American skyscraper—which awed Americans and Europeans alike and inspired unprecedented dynamic forms in design.\nNew freedoms abounded. Women gained the right to vote in 1920 and enjoyed more independence, bending traditional social rules of decorum and engaging in new professions such as interior design. This freer spirit also appeared in art and design through vibrant colors, bold geometric forms, and the use of new materials and experimental production methods. These changes became increasingly visible as the decade progressed and are explored in the exhibition’s six thematic sections: The Persistence of Traditional \"Good Taste,\" A New Look for Familiar Forms, Bending the Rules, A Smaller World, Abstraction and Reinvention, and Toward a Machine Age.",

            "title": "The World of Radio",
            "text": "The World of Radio, a batik mural dedicated to the professional career of soprano and radio star Jessica Dragonette (American, 1900–1980), is the inspiration for the display of radios, drawings, and photographs in this gallery. Spanning more than eight decades, these objects serve as a timeline of radio's development and refinement as a tool for communication and entertainment. Capping this display is the 1934 mural that celebrates Jessica Dragonette's contributions as a radio personality and includes vignettes of important milestones in radio and broadcasting history. These are illuminated against a backdrop of familiar symbols of technological advancement in the modern age.\nMany recognized radio's potential to facilitate long-distance communication, connect people to information, and provide entertainment. Though Guglielmo Marconi (Italian, 1874–1937) first patented his wireless telegraph system in 1896, it was decades before national radio networks emerged in the United States. When Dragonette began performing on the air for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in 1927, the network wasn't even a year old. The U.S. government encouraged cooperation among broadcasting, communication, and technology companies, chiefly AT&T, General Electric, Westinghouse, and Radio Corporation of America (RCA). The government support was the key to the formation of national radio networks.\nAt around the same time, radios powered by household electrical outlets replaced those with the leaky batteries found in hobbyists garages and sheds. Radio's domestication was complete as the newest models easily harmonized with household furnishings and made listening a shared family experience. Later developments included the transistor radio in the 1950s, which replaced vacuum tubes with transistors and made radios small and portable, revolutionizing how we listen to music. Further miniaturization of components impacted the aesthetic qualities of radios while innovations such as satellite and Internet-only radio stations, apps that stream customizable music playlists, and radio programs made available as podcasts changed how we access news and entertainment. Today, radio remains relevant by expanding options that allow us to appreciate an ever-wider array of programming.",

            "title": "Ellen DeGeneres Selects",
            "text": "Hi there! I don’t know if you know this, but I have always had an appreciation and strong passion for the history of design and architecture. During my travels I have had the opportunity to collect rare and unique objects from all parts of the world. I am inspired by each piece: its history and the story it has to tell. This room is filled with a selection of objects whose origins range from ancient Egypt and Peru to mid-20th-century Scandinavia and 21st-century Brooklyn. I hope you enjoy exploring and imagining the histories and stories behind the objects that I have chosen. \n \nThis installation is an intimate and personal look into my design aesthetic, my living space, and the special objects that I have come to love. A few of my pieces are dotted around the room! I like to mix a modern feel with a rustic, antique look. I like the juxtaposition. Here an African mask sits near a wall unit designed by George Nelson and plates by Pablo Picasso share a tabletop with a modern Austrian tea set. \n \nThe Selects exhibition represents all the qualities I love and cultivate in my home. My home is my canvas for inspiration, a place where I generate ideas and learn. I’m always on the search for new, beautiful and interesting objects. And I’m always moving things around and switching things out so I have something new to look at and appreciate.",

            "text": "In Process Lab: Citizen Design we invite visitors to participate in the design process and help envision a better America.\nThrough a series of questions and choices you will be asked to record what you and your community care about, define an issue that matters, and propose design tactics that could make a difference. This process is similar to how designers work when they collaborate with communities to address complex challenges—such as reducing dependence on private cars, improving access to healthcare, or restoring housing after natural disasters.\nConsider how design decisions are made all around you every day and in what ways you might engage, empathizing with other points of view and working collaboratively with community stakeholders to contribute as a citizen designer.\nProcess Lab: Citizen Design is an extension of By the People: Designing a Better America (on view on at Cooper Hewitt through February 26, 2017). The Citizen Design activities are inspired by the GRAY AREA project and developed in partnership with ISA-Interface Studio Architects.",
