Examples using APIs
====================================================

A set of examples using Javascript, React, and some public APIs.


The tools
------------------------------

* A good old text editor. I like `vim <http://www.vim.org/>`_ and, for the more visually-inclined developers, `Atom <https://atom.io/>`_.
* `jq <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`_: a command-line JSON processor.
* `Postman <https://www.getpostman.com/>`_: a GUI for building and testing API requests.
* Modern Javascript, especially ECMAScript 2015 (also known as ES6) and concepts such as `classes <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes>`_ and `arrow functions <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions>`_.
* `React <https://facebook.github.io/react/>`_: a javascript library for building user interfaces.
* `webpack 2 <https://webpack.js.org/>`_: a module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.
* `Babel <https://babeljs.io/>`_: a javascript compiler.
* `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/>`_ and `npm <https://www.npmjs.com/>`_.
* There's a little bit of `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-started/>`_ to run a development container.


The APIs
------------------------------

* `Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum Collections API <https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/api/>`_.
